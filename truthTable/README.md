# Projects

This is a personal project. The objective was to create a script that could compute propositional logic and create tables for my digital system course. The input is a bit specific as it is in its early development and for specific user use. But, here is the overall idea.

-There must be the same amount of set of brackets to amount of operations
-If there are any negation operation or the user wants to have more variables considered in a logic, the use of square brakets are necessary. Ex:(a and b)[a b c d]

Examples of its usage are also downloaded beside the project.


----
Challenges:
-Keep a modular code allowing for quick updates for new propositional logic addition.
-Allow for an unpredetermined amount of operations.
